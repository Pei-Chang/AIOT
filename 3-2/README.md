## 2D SVM with streamlit deployment (3D plot) -dataset 分布在feature plane上圓形
### Prompt
### generate 600 random points centered at (0,0) with variance 10, Y=0 for points in distance less than 4 and Y=1 for the rest. scatter plot. make x3=f(x1, x2) where f is a gaussian function. scatter plot 3d (x1,x2,x3) with Y color. make a linear hyperplane (use light blue color) that can separate the points of Y=0, Y=1
### convert this code to  streamlit deployment (3D plot)  (don't use matplotlib),allow user to input hyperplane as slider
