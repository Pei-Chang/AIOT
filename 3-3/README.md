# 2D dataset 分布在feature plane上非圓形(橢圓形)
## Prompt
create an interactive web application using Streamlit that allows users to visualize data points in a 3D scatter plot. The application should include features such as:<br> 
1. Generating random data points centered at (0, 0) with a specified variance.<br> 
2. Calculating distances from the origin and classifying points based on a user-defined distance threshold.<br> 
3. Implementing a Gaussian function to determine the height of each point in the scatter plot.<br> 
4. Training a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) to find a separating hyperplane based on the classified points.<br> 
5. Providing a slider for users to adjust the distance threshold dynamically, with real-time updates to the scatter plot and hyperplane visualization.<br> 
6. Utilizing Streamlit's built-in components for user interaction, such as sliders and buttons.<br> 

Additionally, include code snippets demonstrating how to implement these functionalities in Python using Streamlit, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn." This prompt is designed to elicit detailed information about using Streamlit for data visualization and machine learning applications, which aligns closely with the content in the search results you provided. It focuses on practical implementation and interactivity, which are key aspects of Streamlit applications.
